Functional Requirements
=======================

This document is parsed by tests/test.py to produce the test cases and
test reports.  See test.py for an overview of how this all works.

Keep the formatting of this file within reStructured text.  Sections
are designated with definition lists; section descriptions and the
implementation table appear within fields.  (One implementation table per
section).

Add a component by adding a row to the appropriate implementation table.  Add
a capability by adding a column where it's needed.  Keep these names to
lower/UPPER case respectively, no non-alphanumeric chars.

Mark off progress for each component/capability pair with:

+---+--------------------------------------------+
| X | Implemented                                |
+---+--------------------------------------------+
| / | Partially implemented (ignored by test.py) |
+---+--------------------------------------------+
|   | Not yet implemented.                       |
+---+--------------------------------------------+

Outside of these boundaries, add any valid reStructured text within
or outside of sections to describe higher-level concerns; this will
be conveniently ignored by test.py.

        TBD:
         - better failure handling when eg. GLX is not available
         - shared OGL context (textures, etc.) between windows

           <ah> sharing one context between all windows means the
           framebuffers are also shared, afaik.  this will be problematic,
           i expect.  next best thing is to share textures and display
           lists between all contexts (by default, allow override).  nothing
           mentioned in GL documentation about programs and buffer objects
           also being shared -- if they're not then there'll be some
           nasty surprises.

           an alternative could be to associate fonts, textures, images,
           sprites, etc with a window.  ugly, maybe.

         - ensure all mouse coordinates are returned as floats
         - scroll wheel is not mouse buttons, despite what X11 will tell
           you; use on_mouse_scroll instead.
         - method to set focus
         - methods to show/hide/minimize/restore
         - OS X does not receive motion events when window doesn't have
           focus; ensure this is also the case for other platforms (or
           find workaround for Carbon).
         - rename "buttonpress", "buttonrelease" to "mousepress", or
           "mousebuttonpress" or "mouse_button_press" or something..?  avoid
           collision with future buttons (e.g. on joysticks), and keep
           consistent with mousemotion.

           <ah> will be on_mouse_press, on_mouse_release, on_mouse_move, etc.

         - similar for enter/leave?
         - event for click, including click_count (for double/triple clicks)
         - or should we delegate this to the gui layer, which will know
           where the click occured?
         - event for context-menu invocation (right-mouse button, ctrl+click
           on mac, menu key on some keyboards).
         - (maybe) event for drag (on os x, this is motion with a button
           down; also consistent with java awt).
         - OS X apps require a unique 4 character creator code.  I have
           registered "PYGL" with Apple, which can be the default; there
           should probably also be a mechanism for people to use their own
           creator codes instead.
         - OS X: update tracking region when window is resized.
         - Minimum/maximum window size.  
         - Enable/disable live resizing? (possible on OS X, what about
           others?)
         - on_expose should include a list of rectangles that were
           invalidated?
         - windows should be created hidden, and shown by method call.  this
           allows applications to get an initial on_show and on_resize event.

           else...)
         - sample shaders
         - what about creating shader trees?
         - what is the value of the usexx methods on ShaderProgram?  do
           we like wrapping objects around GL?

     - should DESIGN be rolled into this document?
