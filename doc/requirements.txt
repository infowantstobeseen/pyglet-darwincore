Functional Requirements
=======================

This document is parsed by tests/test.py to produce the test cases and
test reports.  See test.py for an overview of how this all works.

Keep the formatting of this file within reStructured text.  Sections
are designated with definition lists; section descriptions and the
implementation table appear within fields.  (One implementation table per
section).

Add a component by adding a row to the appropriate implementation table.  Add
a capability by adding a column where it's needed.  Keep these names to
lower/UPPER case respectively, no non-alphanumeric chars.

Mark off progress for each component/capability pair with:

+---+--------------------------------------------+
| X | Implemented                                |
+---+--------------------------------------------+
| / | Partially implemented (ignored by test.py) |
+---+--------------------------------------------+
|   | Not yet implemented.                       |
+---+--------------------------------------------+

Outside of these boundaries, add any valid reStructured text within
or outside of sections to describe higher-level concerns; this will
be conveniently ignored by test.py.

            ============================== === === ===

        TBD:
         - better failure handling when eg. GLX is not available
         - shared OGL context (textures, etc.) between windows

           OSX: you can share objects by passing a context as "share" in
                the aglCreateContext call. That specified context is used
                to store all OpenGL objects created by the new context
                (ie. the new context doesn't have its own object store).

           X11: you can share objects by passing a context as "share_list"
                in the glXCreateNewContext call. That specified context
                is used in the same manner as OSX.

           Win: you call wglShareLists(ctx1, ctx2) to share from one
                context to another. Context ctx1 is used in the same
                manner as OSX sharing. If ctx2 has any objects created
                before calling this function they are destroyed.

           <rj> yes, we should make this the default. We should have a
                global context, but allow the factory to create a new
                context if the programmer wishes. The programmer should
                also be able to pass in another window which they wish to
                share the context from.

           <ah> that won't work: one context per drawable.  current
                implementation  shares the most recently created context
                by default.  can be overridden with
                WindowFactory.set_context_share().

           <rj> This could cause programming errors. We will need to store
                Contexts separately from Windows so that they're only freed
                when there's no references to them.

           <ah> They are stored in pyglet.window._active_contexts, and
                are destroyed when their owning window is destroyed.

         - all platforms: update GL context when window is moved, resized,
           or display properties change (e.g., change resolution).
         - poll: which platforms can do borderless/translucent GL windows?

           OS X: http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/BoingX/index.html

           xlib: http://www.faqs.org/faqs/graphics/opengl-faq/part3/
                 (borderless window, not translucent)

         - ensure all mouse coordinates are returned as floats
         - OS X does not receive motion events when window doesn't have
           focus; ensure this is also the case for other platforms (or
           find workaround for Carbon).
         - event for context-menu invocation (right-mouse button, ctrl+click
           on mac, menu key on some keyboards).
         - (maybe) event for drag (on os x, this is motion with a button
           down; also consistent with java awt).
         - OS X apps require a unique 4 character creator code.  I have
           registered "PYGL" with Apple, which can be the default; there
           should probably also be a mechanism for people to use their own
           creator codes instead.
         - X11 apps have a WM_CLASS - we should allow programmers to supply
           a class name. Should we default it?
         - Enable/disable live resizing? (possible on OS X, what about
           others?)
         - windows should be created hidden, and shown by method call.  this
           allows applications to get an initial on_show and on_resize event.
           OTOH, this would be the cause of many WTF's on the mailing list.

           <rj> allow a "intially hidden" boolean in the window create
           function which defaults to False.

         - events for system sleep/shutdown and display change
         - method to disable screensaver
         - windows appearing on different devices cannot share context.
           there should be a mechanism for dealing with this (besides
           crashing).  moving a window from one device to another should
           recreate the context automatically, and fire an event
           (on_context_lost) to instruct the application to reload everything.
           a similar event (on_context_state_lost) should be fired when
           a context is replaced (for example, toggling fullscreen): in this
           case the app doesn't need to reload objects, but will need to
           reset the state.  yikes.
         - Possible window borders (check that all platforms have reasonable
           support):

            - None
            - Resizable (default)
            - Fixed
            - Palette (smaller footprint)

           With these options:
            - Live resize
            - Maximize button
            - Minimize button
            - Close button / system menu
            - Modal (specify parent)

         - Different exclusive mouse behaviour in Xlib/Win32  (fake where
           the cursor would be) and Carbon (pin mouse at 0,0).  Problem
           with Xlib/Win32: have to update button press/release functions
           to handle the fake as well.  No easy way to adapt this for Carbon.
           Maybe just deal with having x,y=0 while in exclusive?
