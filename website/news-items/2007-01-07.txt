Alex has made good progress on the xhtml/css, layout and related event
code (more <a href="http://www.partiallydisassembled.net/blog/">on his
blog</a>). We're both pretty excited by the prospects opening up on that front.
The mapping in of events to elements is particularly elegant and cool.
I've started the 2d tiles and sprites engine - see examples/driving.py for
a sample of how that's going.
