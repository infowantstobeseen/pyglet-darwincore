The layout package renders XML/HTML+CSS using OpenGL, and will be used for all
layout in the upcoming GUI classes.  Today a big rewrite of this package was
finished, which allows changes to documents at runtime (similar to modifying
a DOM implementation) and better performance.  Some documentation will be
forthcoming; in the meantime you can play with the examples xhtml.py and
browser.py.
