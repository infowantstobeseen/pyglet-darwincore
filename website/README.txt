TO ADD NEWS ITEMS:

Add a file in the news-items folder by copying an existing item to today's
date. The filename just guarantees uniqueness -- if there's >1 post per day
then just add a number to the end.

Once you've written your entry you run:

   python news.py

It will report to you which files need to be uploaded to the site.
Typically this will be news.php and news.xml



TODO items for the website:

- documentation in a wiki with a new top-of-page button

  - cross-ref into API docs 
  - must be able to extract the docs

- API docs


Later:

- screenshots
