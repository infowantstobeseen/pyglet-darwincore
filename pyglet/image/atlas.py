'''Group multiple small images into larger textures.

This module is used by `pyglet.resource` to efficiently pack small images into
larger textures.  `TextureAtlas` maintains one texture; `TextureBin` manages a
collection of atlases of a given size.

Example usage::

    # Load images from disk
    car_image = pyglet.image.load('car.png')
    boat_image = pyglet.image.load('boat.png')

    # Pack these images into one or more textures
    bin = TextureBin()
    car_texture = bin.add(car_image)
    boat_texture = bin.add(boat_image)

The result of `TextureBin.add` is a `TextureRegion` containing the image.
Once added, an image cannot be removed from a bin (or an atlas); nor can a
list of images be obtained from a given bin or atlas -- it is the
application's responsibility to keep track of the regions returned by the
``add`` methods.
